This project is a small, mostly Javascript module for calculating interest on a loan.  I followed a tutorial by TraversyMedia on Udemy to steer me through this build and also to solidify some things that were taught in past lessons.  This is a great one to keep in my notes and refer to often, because everything in it is easily traceable.
